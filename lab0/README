lab0.c - C program that copies its stdin to its stdout. Supports all options
including --input, --output, --segfault, and --catch.

unnecessary files, and a dist target that compresses submission files into
a tarball file.

unrecognizedTest - runs lab0 with argument --jeffrey to check if program can
exits with code 1.

inputTest - runs lab0 with an unreadable input file to check if program exits
with code 2.

segfaultTest - runs lab0 with just --segfault option to check if program exits
with code 139 (segmentation fault).

catchTest - runs lab0 with --segfault and --catch options to check if program
exits with code 4.

2.3.1 - Cycles in the basic list implementation
During the 1 and 2 thread lists tests, most of the cycles are spent within
the critical sections of the list operations.
These can be considered the most expensive parts of the code because they
only allow one thread to execute these sections at a time, thus making
the program slower because multiple threads can't be used to speed it up.
Within the spin lock tests, most of the time/cycles are spent spinning
and waiting for the spin condition allows a thread to obtain the lock. Thus,
many CPU cycles are wasted spinning and waiting for the lock.
With the high-thread mutex tests, most of the time is spent using system calls
because using mutexes means the system has to put threads to sleep until they
can obtain the lock. System calls are expensive and slow the program down.

2.3.3. - Mutex Wait Time
The lock-wait time rises dramtically as the number of contending threads
increases because because more threads cause more contention for the mutex.
Also, there are many threads, but only one thread can enter the critical
section at at time, so time is wasted waiting for the lock to be released
by another thread.
Overall completion time rises less dramatically beacuse although threads,
spend more tiem waiting for the lock, there is always at least one thread
that's making progress at a time, so completion time isn't affected by lock
wait time.
It's possible for the wait time per operation to go up faster and higher
than the completion time per operation because each thread has its own clock
when waiting for the lock, and since multiple threads can be waiting at the
same time, the time that the thread's clock measure overlaps. The overlapped
time is then added into a total, and thus the result is perceived to grow
dramatically. The time per operation timing only relies on a single clock and
we don't have to worry about any overlapping time.

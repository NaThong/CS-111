to get its IP and MAC address. Does not include the process of giving it a
name, password, or setting up it's wifi, but those should be implied.

scp.png - screenshot of the scp command I used to send over a hello.c source
file over to the edison.

compile hello.c into the hello executable, and running it. It printed out
